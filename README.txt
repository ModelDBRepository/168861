Neurite is a finite difference program that simulates the electrical
signal propagation in myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and in
dendritic trees under mechanical loading. The program has two
different solvers---explicit and implicit---that can be executed
sequentially with a CPU processor or in parallel with GPU
accelerators.

To compile the code in UNIX system, type "make" in the root directory
(see in the Makefile for more compiling options). To execute a
simulation, go in the applications folder and follow the Readme.
